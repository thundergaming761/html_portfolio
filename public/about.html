<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings everyone, My name is Kushagra Pandey. I am currently pursuing B.Tech(CSE) at University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) Dehradun. I am from Kanpur, UP. My specialization is in Artificial Intelligence. I have participated in a social internship under Shramik Bharti at Kanpur, where I actively took part in field work. I and my team went to villages enlightening them about the importance of water. We taught them how the water can be saved and how impure water can be treated and consumed. I also helped in the office work there. I collected data from fields about the type of soil there, average rainfall, area that can be used for cultivation and made a report on it. I have a lot of interest in gaming. I have been participating in many Valorant tournaments held by the college. Since childhood I have loved gaming. I also love editing videos. In free time I edit videos and upload them on Youtube. I also love coding. I have been coding on hacker rank where I have 4 stars (silver) in C, C++, Java. My logic building skills are good. If I have good knowledge about the problem, I can provide an efficient solution to it. I have been working on my communication skills because they are very important. There is no value to my answer if I canâ€™t express it properly. I have also created a small project on trains. It is a website which consists of login and sign up. After signing up, the page consists of entering train details, displaying fare, deleting train details and updating train details. I aspire to be a Valorant E - sports player. I want to be the part of team that represents India in Valorant Champions Tour where all the best teams from all over the world compete.</p>
